# Time Bandit
### A Time Management Web App

Time Bandit is a way to track time spent (or time stolen from you!) working on things like freelance projects, school work, house hold chores, or building personal projects that take way too much time to complete. 

Time Bandit began as a simple command line application (see [time_bandit](https://github.com/farmeroy/time-bandit)) built with Rust. I thought, wouldn't this be great on the web!
After trying to rework my original project into a multi-dimensional CLI, Web App mono-repo with shared store logic... I decide to toss the mess and start a separate project.

The back end is still written in Rust, with Axum Web. 

The Basic functionality is that you can create projects that have tasks, and each task is composed of a series of events. Requirements Doc and user stories coming soon...
